# marketing-agency-refactor

## Task

I refactored a marketing agency website to meet a certain set of standards and to implement new technology to make the existing site more accessible.

## Webpage attributes

The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page that can be found in: ](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

## Improvements

For this webpage i ensured that all the links where functioning in the nav bar correctly.

I added semantic HTML elements to the source code.

I organized the semantic structure of the html elements and included comments before each element and section of the page to the source code.

Added alt attributes to all images and icons.

Ensured that the heading attributes followed a sequential order.

I gave the title element a concise and descriptive title.
